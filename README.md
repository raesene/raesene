### Raesene's Repos

I'm a Container Security Advocate who's generally into containers, cloud native, ruby and pentesting.  Most of my repos will relate to one or more of those.

Possible repos of interest that I've been working on recently :-

- [teisteanas](https://github.com/raesene/teisteanas). A Golang app for creating Kubeconfigs using the Kubernetes Certificate Signing Request API.
- [eathar](https://github.com/raesene/eathar). A Golang app for checking the Pod Security Status of workloads on Kubernetes clusters.
- [Kube Security Lab](https://github.com/raesene/kube_security_lab/). This is a setup for learning about Kubernetes security by attacking sample clusters built with [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) . It uses Ansible playbooks to spin up clusters with known vulnerbilities for you to practice on.
- [Container Security Workstation](https://github.com/raesene/container_sec_workstation). A set of Ansible playbooks for automating the building of VMs, WSL instances and Docker images with a variety of handy container security tooling.
- [Container Security Site](https://www.container-security.site/) - Site with some introductory links and information for working with containers, both as a security reviewer and cluster owner.
